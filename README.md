# Transcov

Transcov is a Python tool designed to process *.bismark.cov.gz files generated by bismark_methylation_extractor. It converts these files into *.txt format, enabling seamless downstream analysis in R Studio.

# Features

Converts *.bismark.cov.gz files into *.txt format.
Simplifies preparation for methylation data analysis.
Compatible with R packages such as:
DSS
bsseq
stats
# Installation

Clone or download the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Transcov.git
cd Transcov
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

# Usage

To convert a *.bismark.cov.gz file, use the following command:

python3 convert.py *.bismark.cov.gz
# Input
*.bismark.cov.gz: Output files from bismark_methylation_extractor.
# Output
*.txt: Converted files, ready for analysis in R.
Example Workflow in R

Once you have the *.txt files, you can perform downstream analysis in R. For example:

# Load necessary libraries
library(DSS)
library(bsseq)
library(stats)

# Create a BSseq object
BSobj <- makeBSseqData(...)
This enables advanced methylation feature extraction and statistical analysis.

Requirements

Python 3.x
R environment with the following packages installed:
DSS
bsseq
stats
